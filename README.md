## Contributing

Current members of Frisco ISD CTE Faculty and Emerson Computer Science Club Members are welcome to contribute, create a pull request, include your relation to EHS/Frisco ISD and the changes will be reviewed.

### Setup Environment

To setup a development environment for the repo, make sure [git]([url](git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)) is installed, open a terminal in an empty directory where you'd like the project to be, and run `git clone https://github.com/ParzivalPerhaps/project-showcase-staff-interface` and then access the folder by running `cd project-showcase-staff-interface`.

Then make sure [node and npm]([url](nodejs.org/en/download)) is installed, and run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies.

Use `npm start` to start a local development environment that will likely open on localhost:3000, changes will be reflected there as you save changes to files in the project.

## Operating

To update, pull/push relevant changes into `main` and ask one of the maintainers to deploy it manually (temporary measure).

There is currently no domain associated with the interface.
